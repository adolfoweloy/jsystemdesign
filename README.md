# System design labs

Studying system design is usually associated with interviews. However, it is also a very interesting topic by itself
which one can come up with interesting small projects to practice both programming and system design itself.
I see most people struggling to find something interesting to write in order to practice or learn a programming language.
Studying system design is also a good way to overcome this problem.

Motivated by the ideas above, I created this repository as a place to create some of my own labs around systems design components.

### Terminology

* By component here I mean any component that can be used while designing a system, e.g. load balancer, cache, key-value store etc.
* By lab I mean a small project that implements a component and demonstrates how it works.

### Labs

* Key-value store
